# U2.W4: Homework Cheater!


# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].

# 2. Pseudocode

# Input: Data that will come together to make a coherent homework assignement
# Output: A paragraph about a certian subject that will allow for a decent grade in short order
# Steps: create a method that will take an array of data.  Set methods that will coherently connect that date.


# 3. Initial Solution

  	puts"#{title}"
  	puts ""
  	if "#{pronoun}" == "male" 
  	   puts "My Topic -#{topic}- A man that history will never forget." + " Born in #{date}, #{topic} was extremely influential, and is known today as a Historical Figure." 
  	   puts""
  	   puts "Thesis Statement- #{thesis_statment}" 
  	   puts""
  	   puts "End of Opening Paragraph - While the debate about the true impact of individual 'Historical Figures' continues, it is clear that #{topic} by analysising the impact that #{topic} had on those around him, he has earned his place in history books."
    else

# 5. Reflection 
# I was a little behind this week and was not able to be as creative as I wanted on this one.  I stole the example from the assignment.
# I understand what is going on in this assignment, and did not need any extra help from the internet or any other sources.
# If only this could have been my Solo Challenge!
